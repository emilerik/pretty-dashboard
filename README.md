# Pretty Dashboard!

A dashboard which displays time, weather, a personal greeting and randomized wallpaper. Built in React.

## Installation

1. Clone the project.
2. Navigate to project folder and run `npm install` in order to install dependencies.
3. Type `npm start` to run the app on your browser (http://localhost:3000).
4. (Optional) If using Google Chrome, install [Custom New Tab URL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) and set http://localhost:3000 as custom URL. That way, the Pretty Dashboard gets displayed every time you open a new tab.

## Usage

The app display the current time, as well as an appropriate greeting. In the top left corner, the weather is displayed.

To get the weather from a location other than the default (Link√∂ping), press the settings icon in the top right corner (can be difficult to see in some backgrounds). Enter position with lat/long coordinates, 0-6 decimals. You can also change the display name in the settings.

The background image is a randomized wallpaper from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Due to this, the image is sometimes too light for the text to be visible. You can generate a new background image by clicking button in the bottom right corner.
